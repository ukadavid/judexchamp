            Amb. Alajemba Jude (Mayor) is the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of <span class="comp-name">Judexchamp Pharmacy Nigeria Limited</span>.<br/>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              He is a native of Amihie, Orsu-Ihiteukwa in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State, South East Nigeria. This astute businessman commenced his
              educational career in his native homeland by attending Amihie Primary School before proceeding to Orsu Ihitekwa Secondary School, all in Orsu Local Government Area. 
              In 1998, he ventured into business which was in line with the prevailing circumstances of his peers from the South-Eastern states of Nigeria. This move was taken 
              after ensuring he engaged in necessary tutelage under his relatives in Lagos for his cherished desire to start a business on a small scale.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              With a strong passion and desire for further education, Mayor Alajemba worked assiduously, dealing with pharmaceutical brands. His acumen and sagacity saw him 
              transformed from a small-scale businessman to the establishment of JudexChamp Pharmacy, incorporated under the Corporate Affair Commission (CAC) and registered with 
              the Pharmacy Council of Nigeria (PCN) since 1998.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Aside from the sprawling pharmacy business, Mayor Alajemba is a <em><b>textbook entrepreneur</b></em>, engaged in other striving ventures which include Real Estate, Boutique, 
              Supermarket and Dog breeding. He is happily married to a beautiful and equally industrious wife, Mrs. Lovelyn Alajemba and blessed with lovely children Alajemba has never
              allowed his success in business to prevent him from furthering his education. As a passionate enthusiast of education, Mayor Alajemba, bagged
              an Ordinary National Diploma (OND) and Higher National Diploma (HND) from Ronik Polytechnic where he studied Business Administration and Management. In the year 2000, 
              he gained admission into the University of Lagos in Akoka and graduated with a B.Sc Hons. Degree in Political Science in 2004
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg">
              Mr. Alajemba having had to work to be where he is today, understands the value of hardwork and is aware of the support he had along the way. He therefore pays it forward by 
              continuing in the tradition that had him understudy his relatives, taking it young men as mentees and showing them the ropes. When he is not brokering deals or with his family,
              he is giving back to the society from where he comes, with his philantrophic endeavors, like the Alajemba football competition and other activities.
